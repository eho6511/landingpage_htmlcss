        <p>Having a garden can be a wonderful way to grow your own vegetables, beautify your property, or attract local wildlife. You can plant a large garden in your backyard, or you can plant a small garden if you have limited space. You can even plant a garden using nothing but containers. If you are thinking about starting a garden and you are not sure where to begin, then there are several things that might help. Consider different garden types, prepare your garden plot and tools, select your seeds and plants, and then plant your garden.</p>

        <p>Before you buy any plants, check your soil type: is it light and sandy, or heavy and clay? Many plants thrive better in one type than the other. If you’re not sure, take a look at what plants are growing in your neighbour’s garden.</p>

       Decide what you want to grow or do with your garden. There are many different types of gardens and uses for a garden, so think about what your ideal type of garden would provide.

       Consider how much space you have available. If you have lots of space, then you can plant a garden in the ground. If you have limited space or simply do not want to plant in the ground, then you can also plant a garden in containers.

    <div class="box-3">
       Determine how much sun your plants will get. Many plants require around 6 to 8 hours of full sun to thrive. If you do not have an area that will provide this much sun, then you can still plant a garden. You will just have to choose plants that thrive in the shade or with less sun.
